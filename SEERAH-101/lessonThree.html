  <h1><u>Prophet Muhammad: Younger Years</u></h1>
  <h4 class="title">
    <u>Return To Aminah</u>
  </h4>

  <p class="indent">
    Upon returning to Aminah after some time Aminah decided to take Muhammad to visit her relatives in Yathrib while also wanting to visit her late husbands grave. This was reportedly done when Muhammad was around 6 years old.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    Muhammad spent this time visiting his Kazraji (Banu Khazraj) relatives and enjoyed the company of his distant kinsmen by learning how to swim and fly kites. This happiness was short lived as upon the return journey his mother seriously fell ill
    and passed away in the town of abwa.
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    Some scholars believe that Aminah left for Yathrib with Umm Ayman and Abd al-Muttalib, however others believe Abd al-Muttalib was not their while others believe it was only Aminah and Muhammad. Regardless, somehow Muhammad ended up with his
    grandfather Abd al-Muttalib.
  </p>

  <h4 class="title">
    <u>Time with his Grandfather</u>
  </h4>
  <p class="indent">
    Possibly do to being reminded of the pains of his past due to Aminahs sudden death, Abd al-Muttalib brought Muhammad back to Mecca and treated him with more passion than his own children and made sure he never experienced loneliness.
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    Many things were done that showed Abd al-Muttalib held Muhammad in high regard. For example, Abd al-Muttalib would take Muhammad to nap in the Hijr where none of his sons or grandsons were allowed. Likewise, an area shaded by the Ka’bah had a
    mattress for Abd al-Muttalib where his children would sit around it in honour of their father.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    Muhammad, however, was allowed to sit on the Mattress and whenever someone would attempt to take him off in Abd al-Muttalibs presence would be told “leave, my grandson. I swear by Allah that this boy will hold a significant position.”

  </p>

  <p class="indent">

    Sadly, the relationship ended after 2 years when at the age of 81 Abd al-Muttalib passed away. Muhammad, 8 around this time, was entrusted to Abu Talib the full brother of Abd Allah. Abu Talib and his wife Fatimah bint Asad would treat Muhammad
    with great respect and high esteem and it was obvious that she did all she could to replace the boys mother and both Abu Talib and Fatimah sacrificed much for him just like their own children.
