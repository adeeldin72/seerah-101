  <h1><u>Prophet Muhammad: Teenage Years</u></h1>
  <h4 class="title">
    <u>Living with Abu Talib</u>
  </h4>

  <p class="indent">
    Abd al-Muttalib did not leave his sons with much wealth, some of his sons had developed wealth of their own, however, Abu Talib was not as financially stable compared with his brothers. Due to financial difficulties resulting from all the mouths
    he had to feed and business troubles it became apparent that Abu Talib needed help. Thus, young Muhammad would help to support the family by herding sheep along the hills in Mecca. However, due to coming from a well known family there were
    certain jobs that Muhammad could not do, however, a shepherd was considered a noble job that builds leadership.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    Working as a shepherd allowed Muhammad to experience peace and quiet and reconnect with nature. As aforementioned it was significant that Muhammad lived with the Bedouin Arabs as he was able to from a young age develop an understanding of human
    worth and a relationship with nature something that is believed to be imperative of deep faith. By observing and understanding nature one can form the basis of faith and instead of just reciting religious scriptures without understanding can
    instead being to understand the true meaning of faith.
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    Working as a shepherd Muhammad naturally would be required to be humble doing repetitive tasks such as serving sheep, delivering baby sheep and guarding them from predators, would require him to remove pride and arrogance and become more humble.
    It is reported the prophet said “Verily, Allah is beautiful and loves beauty. Pride is denying (and turning away from) the truth, and looking down upon people (deeming oneself to be superior to them).”

    <u>Caravan Incident</u>
  </h4>
  <p class="indent">
    At the age of 12, Muhammad went on a trade journey, I.e. a commercial caravan, to Syria with his uncle Abu Talib. Acompayning Muhammad on this trip was the young Abu Bakr and Bilal whom Muhammad would one day form a deep bond with lasting
    throughout their adult life. As the men neared Syria a Christian monk named Bahira noticed that the world seemed to be following the caravan. The clouds would be following them and when they stopped to rest a tree shifted to shade them. Intrigued
    by the mysterious travellers, Bahira invited the group to dinner in order to find the special person in the caravan causing all this.
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    According to scriptures it is recorded that Bahira already knew what the telltale signs of prophethood were. Thus, he knew what he was looking for. After meeting the men and studying everyone he was disappointed not being able to find the face of
    a prophet. After reminding the men that he offered his hospitality to everyone he asked if everyone on the caravan was present Bahira was notified that the youngest was left back to guard their cargo and camels. Upon his request, men were sent to
    retrieve Muhammad who was the one assigned to guard the cargo. Upon meeting Muhammad Bahira recognized the prophet took his hand and said “This is the master of all humans. Allah will send him with a Message which we’ll be a mercy to all beings”.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    Abu Talib is reported questioning how Bahira could possibly know this and Bahira answered “When you appeared from the direction of the Aqabah all stones and trees prostrated themselves, which they never do except for a prophet. I can also
    recognize him by the seal of the prophethood which is below his shoulder, like an apple. We have found this in our books.”

  </p>

  <p class="indent">

    Bahira urged Abu Talib to protect the young boy from evil and was reported stoping Muhammad from proceeding toward Syria in fear of the Romans and Jews and having Abu Talib have men escort Muhammad back to Mecca.
  </p>

  <p class="indent">

    Bahira is described as person with coarse fitting clothes who lived a simple life in his monastery which was on the main Caravan route; and while looking out the window saw the approaching caravan. Some scholars do not believe that this was a
    legitimate event and believe it was fabricated however, majority of scholars agree with its authenticity which would then make Bahira the first person to identify the prophet.
  </p>

  <p class="indent">

    Most of the prophets teenage years were spent in solitary as this was the life of a shepherd. As aforementioned, the life of a shepherd was considered a noble job that built leadership. A shepherd can also develop solitude, patience,
    contemplation and watchfulness skills.
