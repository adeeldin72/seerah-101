    <p><u>Who are we?</u>
    </p>
    <p>We are a small website that aims to provide free religious and historical education for all visitors. Currently we are focusing specifically on the Seerah but we one aim to create a parent site that will include a diverse amount of
      content suitable for all visitors.

    <p> <u> Why we created this site?</u>
    </p>
    <p>We created this site because in our experiences religion was something we were just told to do and when we asked questions we rarely every got our questions answered. Thus, we decided to first create a site that focuses on our religion Islam
      at the
      begining. Our goal is that kids and adults who are confused and/or not sure of Islam and the Prophet can find the answers they are looking for. Of course we have tried to make our site as unbiased as possible as in not to push our views on the
      readers. </p>

    <p><u>Adeel : Developer, Student</u>
    </p>
    <p>I enjoy learning new things but find that at times it is quite difficult to find the resources you need. For example, you may enjoy drawing digital art but not have the money available to buy a drawing tablet and/or the time to sit down and
      practice. In my case I enjoyed learning about Islam and web design. One problem though is I can learn something new everyday but once I stop using that information I'll forget about it. Likewise, I do not have the time to work on each of my
      interests for a couple hours a day. So I decided to combine both of my interests into one product so I can simultaneously work on both things and retain the information I have learned.
