  <p class = "indent">
    Prophet Muhammad was born to the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe around the year 570 CE to Abdullah and Aminah. Born in the year of the elephant, a reference to the event where the governor of Yemen Abraha, set out to destroy the Ka’bah
    in retaliation for his cathedral being defiled, and as the story goes was ultimately defeated by god.

  <h4 class = "title"><u>Year of the Elephant</u></h4>

  <p class = "title">
    The year of the elephant occurred approximately in the year 570 CE. The leader of Yemen an Ethiopian king named Abraham al-Ashram envied the reverence of the Ka-bah. Not due to it being an threat to there religion, but because the Ka’bah was a great economic rival. In trying to compete with the Ka’bah, Abraha had his people create a grand cathedral in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, named Yemeni Al-Ka’bah. Abraha believed that he could use the grand cathedral to have the pilgrims come to his city and thus spend their money there. However, there were many Arabs that took this as a threat and a man from Bani Kinanah set out to the grand cathedral and defiled it. In retaliation, Abraha rounded up 55+ thousand soldiers and several elephants and they marched their way to the Ka,bah to destroy it.

  <p class = "title">Along the way Abraha first stopped at Ta,if. Believing that Abraha has mistaken them for the Quraysh, the Thaqif redirected Abraha and his army towards the direction of Mecca. Outside of the city Abraha again stopped at Muhammis, and looted and raided the area taking 200 camels with them, which later on turn out to belong to Abd al-Muttalib. Now outside of the holy city, Abraha stopped and asked to meet with the leader of Quraysh. However, due to recent events the Quraysh had no leader and thus decided to send there most respected representative, Abd al-Muttalib. In some sources A man from the tribe of Himyar was sent by Abraha to Quraish to warn them that he is only here to demolish the Ka-bah and if anyone comes in his way they will be crushed. So Abd al-Muttalib should already have some idea of why Abraha is here. There conversation is not well known but while speaking with Abd al-Muttalib Abraha was so impressed with the representative that he decided to give him one favour. Abd al-Muttalib asked for his camels to be returned to him, however, Abraha told Muttalib that he was so impressed with Muttalib that if he was asked to return home he would have, but instead of protecting the religious centre of his and his forefathers, Muttalib asked for his camels to be returned. Abraha not has lost respect for Muttalib and is nearing the end of there discussion. And al-Muttalib explains to Abraha that he is the rightful owner of the camels and they should be returned to him and just like how he is the owner of the camels they Ka’bah has its own owner and the owner will protect it if the owner surely chooses. Abraha orders the camels to be returned and either the same or next day resumed his march towards the Ka’bah. </p>

  <p class = "title">Abd al-Muttalib ordered the Meccans to seek refuge in the surrounding hills and himself and a few representatives remained in the Ka’bah praying for Allah to defend the Ka’bah and later went to the hills of Abu Qubays. While marching towards the Ka’bah Mahmud the lead elephant refused to continue forward. No matter what Mahmud guide tried the elephant refused to go forward. Suddenly, the sky went black and a strange sound was heard. As the sky got darker the sound grew larger. The sky was full of birds as far as they could see. Survivors are told to have said that each bird had stone in each of their feet and inside their beak dropping them onto Abraha and his army. It is told that the stone fell with such velocity that even their armour were being pierced. Abrahas army moments away from the Ka’bah were suddenly decimated and the few remaining survivors fled to back to Yemen.

    While on a caravan trip between Medina and Mecca, Muhammad’s father Abdullah/Abd Allah fell seriously ill in Yathrib passing away about 6 months prior to his sons birth. The news reached Aminah which made her days more difficult as she was
    expecting her first child.

    The birth of Muhammad had many reports of certain miracles occurring. None of these can be relied as decisive proof as they are not related to one another. However, even without proof it is strongly believed that miracles did occur. It is
    reported
    that Aminah had a dream prior to her delivery of giving birth to a light and being told to name her baby Muhammad and on her delivery day many witnesses claim to have seen a light emanate from her. All the idols in the Ka’bah fell to the ground,
    it
    is narrated that a group of Quraysh people had an idol they worshiped in the Ka’bah one day they went to the idol but it was on the ground. Multiple times they tried to put the idol back up but it would fall back down and after the third time
    they
    heard “One person was born, the whole earth had shaken. All the idols fell down, the hearts of kings trembled with horror!”. Parts of the Persian rulers palace were destroyed it is believed 14 of his towers fell. Likewise the dominant religion in
    Persia, Zoroastrianism, began to crumble. Waters of the Sawa lake either receded and the lake dried up that night or temples on the lake drowned.
