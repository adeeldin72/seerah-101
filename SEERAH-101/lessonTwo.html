    <u>Halimah and Harith</u>
  </h4>

  <p class="indent">
    The Quraysh held respect for the Bedouin Arabs as they believed living in the desert led the Bedouin Arabs to live a freer, healthier, and nobler lifestyle. It was believed that one would not be corrupted by the city life as to survive in a
    desert one needs high level of respect for human worth.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    Due to this the Quraysh had a tradition of entrusting the care of the young to Bedouin foster families. Likewise, the Bedouin foster families relied on this as a form of income. In other words, the Bedouin Arabs would be paid to take care of the
    Quraysh children. Think of it as a form of babysitting.
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    Belonging to one of these desert communities was Halimah bint Abi Dhu’ayb and her husband Harith ibn ‘Abd al –‘Uzzah the couple who would eventually take care of Muhammad.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    It is important to note that Aminah could not possible afford to pay the Bedouin Arabs to take care of Muhammad. Thus, Aminah was not able to find a Bedouin-Foster couple who would be wiling to take care of her orphaned son.
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    It is narrated that Halimah and her husband left her village with a group of other women from the same tribe to find children to suckle. This was reportedly done because after a series of famine and drought they wanted a children to suckle as
    they were interested in the reward they would receive from the Childs father.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    However, Halimah and her husband being the poorest from their clan were also not able to find any one Quraish family who were confident they would be able to care for their children. Halimah met Aminah and knew that she would not be able to pay
    for her services, as she is a widow, but reluctant to return without a single child she asked her husband if they can just take Muhammad instead of returning empty handed. It is reported her husband agreed saying “There is no harm in doing so and
    perhaps Allah might bless us through him”. I.e. the parents are reported to have decided that as while there would be no financial benefit from taking Muhammad it is possible they may get blessings and rewards from Allah for doing something good.
    This would later on prove to be a positive impact on both the prophets life and their own.

  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    It is important to note that Halimah had many hardships that required them to go out to Mecca in the first place. She and her she-camel did not have enough milk which led to sleepless nights as her own child would cry out of hunger. Her lands
    were dry and barren causing the wild animals to leave and whatever animal remained was not of good heath.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    Upon departing for their lands from Mecca many good fortunes began happening for Halimah and her husband. The traveling group for one was astonished to find that the donkey Halimah was riding suddenly began to become healthy and lively. When she
    went to suckle her babies she realized that she now has enough milk for both of them and they were able to sleep peacefully. Likewise, the she-camel was also now able to provide milk. Her husband is reported saying that Halimah has gotten a
    blessed child. Lastly, upon returning to their lands what they found waiting for them was lush grass and the wild animals returning.
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
Muhammad stayed with Halimah and had several foster brothers and sisters. Halimah and Harith would take care and love Muhammad as if he were their own son, and would regularly take Muhammad back to visit Aminah for 4-5 years.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
Originally Muhammad was supposed to go back to his biological family after 2 years however due to all the blessings Halimah and Harith were receiving they requested to keep Muhammad for some more time. During his final years of living with Halimah and Harith an incident happened involving Muhammad, which the prophet would narrate himself.
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
“Two men in white clothes came to me with a golden basin full of snow. They rook me and split open my body, then they took my heart and split it open and took out from it a black clot which they flung away. Then they washed my heart and my body with that snow until they made them pure…”
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
One of the two men was Gabriel the snow used is reported to have actually been Zamzam water and the black clot was a blood clot removed by Gabriel who said “That was the part of Satan in thee”. This event would result in either Aminah deciding to take back Muhammad because of being apart from him for so long and/or Halimah deciding to return Muhammad out of concern for the boy.
